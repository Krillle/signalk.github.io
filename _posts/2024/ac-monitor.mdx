From the [Boating with the Baileys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfcuaeJ7gts) YouTube channel:

> Join us as we install an AC monitor on our sailboat and dive into some cool tech upgrades! 🛥️ With the help of Node-RED, we convert AC amps from the SensESP sensor to watts, then calculate the cost per hour of our energy usage. This is just the start of our journey with Node-RED, and we're excited to share it with you! ⚡️

> We’ll also take you behind the scenes of my solar controller project, where I create beautiful graphs in Grafana to track our solar power usage—perfect for monitoring through the Victron app. Whether you're into sailing, family adventures, or just love boat life tech, this video has something for you!
