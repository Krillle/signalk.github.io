Mat Bailey from the [Boating with the Baileys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s95pnxifGdQ) YouTube channel has created a fantastic video on how to set up Node-RED in SignalK and OpenPlotter. The video covers the basics of Node-RED, step-by-step instructions, and even includes a hands-on sailing project where they control an LED to display the charge states of their Victron Blue Smart Charger.
