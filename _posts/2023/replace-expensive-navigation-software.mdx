From the [Holly and Ray](https://www.youtube.com/@HollyandRay) YouTube channel:

> We have recently ditched our expensive navigation software in favor of Signal K and OpenCPN, free alternatives. When planning passages, we can now plot the best course for the weather and current, transfer that course to multiple devices aboard Sabado, overlay radar, and customize our anchor watch alarm. Using Grafana and influxDB, we have also designed a page displayed on our nav desk monitor screen (and on mobile devices while away) that tracks our energy and water levels, refrigeration temperatures, propane and fuel tank levels, and more! The color-coded data and speech-enabled alarms have taken the mystery out of our boat: we can check everything on one screen, and there are no unidentified beeps!
>
> An added bonus to this new system is that it is all free and open-source software, including the Linux operating system.
