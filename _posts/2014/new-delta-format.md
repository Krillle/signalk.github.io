Signal K has a new format for specifying model changes. Now, instead of sending
the entire model whenver a value changes, we can send just the changes using
the format below. An example of a delta message is presented below.

```json
{
  "context": "vessels.230099999",
  "updates": [
    {
      "source": {
        "pgn": "128275",
        "device": "/dev/actisense",
        "timestamp": "2014-08-15T16:00:05.538Z",
        "src": "115"
      },
      "values": [
        {
          "path": "navigation.logTrip",
          "value": 43374
        },
        {
          "path": "navigation.log",
          "value": 17404540
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "source": {
        "device": "/dev/actisense",
        "timestamp": "2014-08-15T16:00:00.081Z",
        "src": "115",
        "pgn": "128267"
      },
      "values": [
        {
          "path": "navigation.courseOverGroundTrue",
          "value": 172.9
        },
        {
          "path": "navigation.speedOverGround",
          "value": 3.85
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The first attribute of the delta object is `context`. The `context` attribute
identifies the specific source system which the delta update applies to. In the
example above, the context is a vessel with an MMSI of 230099999. If this
context doesn't exist (i.e. this is a new source system), a new context will be
created in the model at the specified path.

Next, there is an array called `updates` which contains 1 or more update
objects. The update object consists of `source` and `values` where the source
describes the device which generated the update (this could be a sensor, chart
plotter, computer or whatever) and the values array is an array of update
objects which consists of a path and a value.

Paths are dot delimited and it is expected that the consumer propagates the
source timestamp down all of these paths.
